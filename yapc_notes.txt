Venue security? Venue WIFI? Eh.

Otherwise, great place, would go again.

Day 1:
    MetaCPAN, the tour
        I'm becoming more of a CPAN guy (PAUSE ID: JACOBY) so making tooling around
        it is good. 
    Continuous Integration for CPAN
        For deploying, we have CPANTesters, 
            which tests against everything from old supercomputers to new toasters
        For development, we have Travis-CI, which tests against Linux, and the 
            infrastructure is pretty good (but they drag behind, so add new Perl5 
            a month after release). MacOS is OSX in config, and a bit buggier.
            For Windows, there's Appveyor, but Perl integration is less than mature 
            (I need FreeBSD, which I'm told is available via GitLab, ) 
    Dockerizing CPANTesters
        More than fits in my head, so I can't explain. Will have to watch again.
    Variables, Scopes and Namespaces
        Joel thought it was too remedial for me, suggested I go to another talk, but...
        I found a use for "Monkeypatching", which is
            use LibToConnectToAPI ;
            local *LibToConnectToAPI::get = sub { return { this_cool => 'object' } }
            is( function_using_get() , 'object' , 'function munges right' );

    ES6: Almost an acceptable Perl 5?
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwCAFPKwAyE
        "use strict;" 
        var -> function-level scoped
        let -> lexical scoped -> like 'my' -> GOOD
        const -> constant (but const foo = { 'bar' : 1 } ; foo.bar = 27 ; still works)
        ES6 adds class
            class Foo extends Bar {
                constructor (...) {...}
                methodName (...) {...}
            }
        MST Suggestion:
            use transpiler
            read generated code
            get better at base JS for when you have to use it
        use lodash to get lots of Perlish stuff.
            but remember map( array , function ), while Perl uses map { function } array
        Dojo was mentioned (BoilerUp!)
        ES6 isn't everywhere
            babel! 
        mobx ?
        ...object ? Is this a mobx thing? a React thing? an ES6 thing?

        function o2 () 
            + puns
                + o2 == oo == object orientation
                + moving toward a subset of Moo 
                + Bluefeet's previous attempt was 'o', and this is spiritual successor
                + Sensible OO is "Oxygen" to programmers
            + puns
                + 4 puns in two characters
                + "I am a terrible person, but I regret nothing"
        fat arrows are lambdas
        "the 'tests' are at the bottom of the file, because I couldn't work out
            which are everyone's favorite testing frameworks this ... hour"
        "I want to make a decision and stick with it. I know that's very unjavascriptish of me"
        ES6 bends like Perl 5 

        Is ES6 an acceptable Perl 5? ****ed if I know, but it's FUN!
    Lightning Talks:
        LATER
    Keynote from SawyerX
        Deprecations from 5.0 are finally being pulled out of the language
        Just as '.' shouldn't be in PATH, '.' is now no longer in @INC

Day 2:
    Dancing in the Cloud
        Dancer web framework on 
        >   Docker containerized setups using 
        >   Kubernetes and etcd as key-value store for configuration and  
        Do you live in this world? I don't.
    Test2
        listening to the diffs between Test and Test2 give a hint on how 
        to test, which is good
    Adventures in Failure
        different languages and systems error out in different ways
    Keynote from Damian Conway - Three Little Words
         "I ‚ù§ Perl"

    Aside - This and Stevan Little's Day 3 talk are about trying to get Object Oriented
        Programming into Perl 5 without too much "damage"
        "Moose brings in half of CPAN"
        Damian's method contrasts with Stevan's 
        Stevan's been trying for years
        Moxie vs Dios

Day 3:
    Logs are magic: Git workflows and commit structure
        Just watch it.
    Amazon, Alexa and Perl 
        A Software Stir talk hit the backend a lot, and how hard it is for them
            "Alexa, have Domino's order me a Pizza"
             ^wakeword   ^                   ^
                         service provider    task 
        most everything else ignored
        But main Q I had ("How do I make it work with something *I* wrote?") was 
            handwaived to "give it an API"
        Here, it goes to Jason's home so that it can receive and turn on/off lights
    MAKE New Friends
        Conference-Driven Development 
        Use Raspberry Pi, speech recogntion, text-to-speech to make an inexpensive
            Scrum Master bot
    Mojolicious, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL to make a chat app in 50 lines of code
        Need to gain Mojo
        Need to learn Vue
    Hold My Beer 
        See Damian Conway's Three Little Words
    The Variable Crimes We Commit Against JavaScript
        I could go into this one in many ways
        More introduction to variables 
        Lingers at points that MST speeds past
        (MJD?)
    Lightning Talks
        We WILL see the SANE talk
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ60vVOKVr0

A mongers group (Houston.pm?) is doing a TPC::NA Lightning Talk Jukebox. Worth doing?
