I am a guitar player. I think this winter will mark 40 years since I found a small-sized Harmony acoustic guitar under the Christmas tree. Currently, I am the proud owner and player of:

* 2 acoustic guitars
* 5 electric guitars (I think)
* 1 12-string octave guitar
* 2 lap steel guitars
* 1 pedal steel guitar
* 1 mandolin

Mostly, guitars have strings that are locked in place on one end and tightened on the other. Typically, the locking is via the string tension — the string is run through a hole, but the ball end is too big and can't go through — and the other end is run through a hole and wrapped around. If not, there's a mechanical thing to stop the string from moving. There are locking tuners where there's a vice mechanism that gets tightened, and that holds the string. In acoustic guitars, there's often a removable bridge pin that holds things in place. Mostly the tuners are on the headstock at the end of the neck, but not always.

With hard-tail guitars, the issue of tuning is pretty simple, in that you turn the tuners to tighten the string, and unless there's a mechanical problem with the tuner, it stays there. There's a bit of balance between the neck and the strings, and steel-string guitars mostly have truss rods of metal or carbon that serve to help the neck stay straight against the tension caused by the strings. If you break a string, everything else goes a little flat.

And of course, we start out with an inheirent tension, because a string plays at a certain pitch because of tension and string gauge. A .042 and .052 string can be tuned to the same frequency, but is going to a lot less tight with the .042 strings.

And then came Leo Fender.

Leo Fender was never a player. He made things, starting with a radio repair shop. I'm primarily a Telecaster player, and the Telecaster and Stratocaster came from his imagination. Part of the Stratocaster is the [^1] "Synchronized Tremolo" bridge, which is an improvement over the Bigsby in that it's easier to get the instrument back in tune after you use it, but neither were built for what you would call intense use.

With vibrato systems, instead of locking the strings at each end in as stable a system as possible, you balance the tension of the strings with springs, and you use the tremolo arm (or "whammy bar") to play with that balance to raise (a little) or lower (a little) the pitch of a note or chord. But there are common problems. There are windings at the tuners that, if loosened and tightened again, might not sit the same way. There's a slot in the nut (and less so the saddle) that could bind the string and keep it from going back to where it was. There's a place where the string's ball-end sits where it could sit differently if made too loose. Fender's synchronized tremolo was more stable than the Bigsby vibrato, but it wasn't supportive of expressive playing.

For example, there's a story I read in a guitar magazine, where D.A. Pennebaker had taken early footage he had shot of the Monterey Pop Festival to show to musicians who couldn't make that show, including Jimi's festival-closing show. Jimi went into ["Wild Thing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVN8_7wVSG0) and dive-bombed the strings at the start, and Eric, who knew Jimi but did not know what happened at Monterey Pop, commented loudly that Jimi had "done it", knocked the guitar he specially painted for the event out-of-tune for the rest of the set.

Of course, Jimi proceeds to set the guitar on fire before smashing it.

A man named Floyd Rose considered the whole of the problem and decided there are three main things that can be done to fix the problem: Lock the strings in place in the bridge, lock the strings in place at the nut, and remove friction in the bridge by replacing six mounting screws with two posts, and making the bridge sit on the posts with a very thin edge.

So, there's a balance between the strings and the neck, and a balance between the strings and the springs, and, as a hardtail player, I'm used to not having to deal with any of that. I can go from very thin strings to very thick strings with minimal changes on my Telecasters, but there are drastic changes required for vibrato-equipped guitars.

Until my youngest was given an inexpensive guitar with a Floyd Rose, and there was a problem with it. The parts that hold where the whammy bar actually attaches got loose, and I had to do some research and disassembly in order to figure out how to reattach it. I also had to pull out a big pile of tools.

It was strung previously with strings gauged .009-.042 (coloquially "nines"), while the strings I had on hand were .010-.046 (coloquially "tens"), and that amounts to about 20 lbs of string tension, and that threw the balance right off. 

[^1]: Leo Fender did not know the difference between [vibrato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato) and [tremolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo). His Vibrolux amp has a "vibrato" circuit that's an example of tremolo, and the "synchronized tremolo" bridge of the Stratocaster is an example of vibrato. In this blog post, I am talking about vibrato and will use vibrato and tremolo interchangably to talk about what the Synchronized Tremolo, Bigsby and Floyd Rose systems do, which is vibrato.
