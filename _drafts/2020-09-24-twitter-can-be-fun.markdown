I was on Twitter a day or so ago and got a notice along the lines of _"We have noticed unusual activity and think there's a problem. Click every picture that contains a fire hydrant."_

So I did. I know it's more about looking at the pattern and time between my choices over the choices themselves that determines if I'm me, but the choices (potentially, with mine aggregated with thousands of others) helping autos of the future know what's a hydrant and what's a short pedestrian, so I thought nearly nothing of it.

And now I can't tweet. I can't retweet. I can't like tweets.

At least I can't with my main twitter account, [@jacobydave](https://twitter.com/jacobydave/). I can still use the mostly-bot accounts for [HackLafayette](https://twitter.com/hacklafayette)/[Purdue Perl Mongers](https://twitter.com/purduepm), the distinguishing features between the two being decreasingly small, and [the one that currently tells you when I've updated my computers but used to also have an hourly picture](https://twitter.com/jacoby_log). I also had intended to start splitting my "social" and "work" interactions and made [an account named after my previous blog](https://twitter.com/varlogrant), plus a few other testing accounts I don't even know exist anymore.

Honestly, I have no idea why anyone thinks I'm not a bot. Because doom-scrolling, the likely big difference in my Twitter interaction between this week and the past is that I'm likely down.

[I mean, unless I start my paranoid thinking.](https://jacoby.github.io/2020/09/21/twitters-face-recognition-has-issues.html) [I was harsher in Twitter than in my blog](https://twitter.com/JacobyDave/status/1308101266455834631), backing off on the snark as I added context and word count, but still.

Would they punish a user because they're critical of Twitter? A quick scan and the actually more biting critiques seem to be working fine. So the only thing I am sure about is that this is an annoyance, but so far, a minor one.

My [#FollowFriday](https://jacoby.github.io/2019/07/05/the-social-experiment-of-followfriday.html) post will go out on VarLogRant tomorrow, and we'll see about the rest later.

#### If you have any questions or comments, I would be glad to hear it. Ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacobydave) or [make an issue on my blog repo.](https://github.com/jacoby/jacoby.github.io)
