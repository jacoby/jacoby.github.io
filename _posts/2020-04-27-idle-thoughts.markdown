![Broken FitBit Charge 2](https://jacoby.github.io/images/fitbit_band.jpg)

I say "idle" in the sense that I'm barely moving. I stand and sit at my desk, then move maybe four feet away, and I _still_ somehow broke the strap of my Fitbit Charge 2. Amazon will be shipping me a new band soon, and the device itself is perfectly fine.

I don't "make my steps" often. It was unlikely a year ago when the biggest walk I took most days was between where I parked and where I worked and back, and when I started going to a coworking space, that distance became much shorter, and now that it's between the bedroom and living room, it's glancingly small. I had been waiting for warm days before I started walking more, but now...

I _mostly_ use FitBit to tell me that I'm sleeping poorly, like last night; where I slept from 11pm to 2am or so, then again from about 5am to 8am, meanwhile **really** wanting to be asleep from 2am to 5am.

I had _some_ coffee at HackLafayette Coffee & Chat, and I normally don't on weekends. I even had some Diet Coke after. So _maybe_ I messed up my sleep because of how much I've fallen off my previous rules:

- 2 cups of coffee a day
- before noon
- on days that I am going to be programming

I stopped counting in November, because the mechanism I used to count to coffee intake, I made so I could do other database-backed web stuff, and I'm no longer there, and while I'm curious about creating a new tool that would allow me to:

- track my coffee intake
- and theoretically others
- from anywhere on the internet
- securely
- using modern cool web tools

But I've been finding my space in the new position and thus haven't been open for new ideas beyond toy tasks. With my new developer shrine, I'm getting back into the swing of things. I could do 3/5 of the above:

- track my coffee intake
- from anywhere on the internet
- securely

by using one of my spare Twitter accounts to DM "1 cup" at myself and count from there. This would be reasonably easy to do, and I already have the mechanism to announce to the world for accountability. This wouldn't help me skill up, but it _would_ help me with self-control.

And maybe mean I can sleep through the night.
