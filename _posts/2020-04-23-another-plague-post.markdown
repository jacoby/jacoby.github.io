Today was a good day.

A few things that I've been trying to pull into my head and push out as code are finally coming together. I'm not the dev I want to be, but I'm getting there.

In sorta celebration, I ordered monitor arms and a laptop tray, so I can get my developer shrine _that much closer_ to the ideal. I can leave it, come back tomorrow and easily get back to dev mind and the task I was at. It is the thing I miss about the setup I had in the previous job, and it's coming together.

It's game night, and it's [Illuminati!](http://www.sjgames.com/illuminati/) by Steve Jackson Games. _**Conspiracy!**_ Niel won, by asserting he was playing by the "Special" rules while, trying to minimize complexity, I was playing the "Normal" rules. But, eh?

Gizmo and I finally got some MySQL magic going, so that means things like track counting and maybe even my **#FollowFriday** nerdfight, but no promises on that one.

Stay safe and stay well.
