It's been stated that, if you're one in a million, that means there are at least 7,000 people out there just like you.

I know of at least 7 people with my name.

There's a state senator in Iowa.

There's a maker of fine pool cues.

There's a Swedish IT security evangelist.

There's a professor emeritus of History at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

There's a sports podcaster. I used to get tweets meant for him all the time.

And there's a restaurateur in Greater Los Angeles. 

This I know because he was trying to connect with a ride-share/food-delivery service. Presumably, he meant the conversation to go to his restaurant address and his personal email address.

Except it was *my* personal address it was sent to.

At first, I was entirely unsure whether it was a strange phishing attempt or not, and as I don't feed the trolls, I don't pheed the phish. But today, I received a username, initial password and PIN for this service, and I decided that it looked real enough that I needed to get my deniability on.

This is one *really good* thing about web forms, that they ask you to put your email in there twice, usually, and send a confirmation email to that address, saying "if you didn't intend to use this service, don't click confirm."

I don't know to what extent I could have created mischief with this access, but I have to think that I could've caused some. Since, as I always say, I do web-but-not-web and don't have many authentication problems in my domain, I don't know the best practice for this, but somehow, the service did not use it.
