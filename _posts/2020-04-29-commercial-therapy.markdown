![New Band for my FitBit](https://jacoby.github.io/images/new_band.jpg)

I'm in love with the modern world.

Specifically, the logistic miracle that allows me to say "Hey, I've broken my watch band, and also want a USB-3 to USB-C adapter and a bigger power strip" on Monday, and have it show up in my mailbox on Wednesday.

I mean, [I know.](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/16/20696392/amazon-prime-day-2019-boycott-strikes)

Tomorrow, the swing-arms for my monitor and my laptop should be coming, and a hook to hang my backpack off my standing desk will be coming ... on a slow boat from China, I think.

Meanwhile, thanks to the inexpensive grey band for my FitBit, I can track how poorly I sleep tonight, as my subconscious mind ponders how I live in a [hidden COVID-19 hot-spot](https://fortune.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-hotspots-us-states-reopen-economy/amp/), according to Fortune magazine and Dataminr.

Isn't _that_ great?

Another thing purchased but also _not here yet_ is the next Murderbot book, [_Network Effect_](https://publishing.tor.com/networkeffect-marthawells/9781250229861/). (For me, e-book.) Tor gave out the four novellas last week, and I just got drawn in. It'll be here the same day a replacement set of Bluetooth earbuds comes, to replace the same kind, except those stayed in a pocket when I did laundry.

[I recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/JacobyDave/status/1249810535610290177):

> Might just be me, but I'm feelin' more Islands in the Net by [@bruces](https://twitter.com/bruces) than Neuromancer by [@GreatDismal](https://twitter.com/GreatDismal) recently.

This came about because of a few tweets noting that [certain aspects of the current day](https://twitter.com/emercer/status/1249651714476695553) [seemed decidedly cyberpunk](https://twitter.com/bethcodes/status/1249510968301764608). As a teen, that was _my_ _jam_, even if that terminology wasn't en vogue in my teens, but now, well into middle age, there's lots in [_Islands In The Net_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218571.Islands_in_the_Net) by [Bruce Sterling](https://brucesterling.tumblr.com/) that remind me of the current day. Looking back, there are many points where 80s Bruce didn't recognize where tech would go in the 90s and beyond — people seem to largely be doing their data transfer over dialup, for example — but there's a lot of the first half of the book that looks like modern remote work and Zoom conversations.

And, speaking of cyberpunk, the artist [Rob Sheridan](https://twitter.com/rob_sheridan) released a series of masks from his ["Glitchy Goods" threadless shop](https://robsheridan.threadless.com/), which [ship from Corona, California.](https://twitter.com/rob_sheridan/status/1254938716604207105). I'm thinking that this just the thing to make _me_ feel like a cyberpunk protagonist as I don a mask and tell my digital assistant to darken the room behind me.

Maybe I need to get myself a leather trenchcoat.
