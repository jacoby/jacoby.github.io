I hate magic.

Jekyll contains lots of magic.

GitHub played with the magic, trying to allow you to change your theme 
without editing your `_config.yml` by hand. 

Problem is, `jekyll-theme-minimal` doesn't work. At least for me.

`minima` works for me.

This doesn't give me much hope for this system. 

I'm thinking that running the build before committing, be it Jekyll, HiD, 
Statocles, or some magic Template thing you roll yourself, is the way to go.
