Today was taco night. Taco Tuesday, so very appropriate.

My family has been re-watching _Barry_, and after work and during breaks, I've been watching it for the first time. I am actively trying to avoid picking up new open-ended series, so I don't _want_ to get pulled in. OTOH, Bill Hader. Loved his work on SNL, and seriously? Documentary Now! is on Netflix.

[Tor](https://ebookclub.tor.com/) has been giving away novelas from [Martha Wells' Murderbot series](http://www.marthawells.com/murderbot.htm), leading up to the release of the novel _Network Effect_. It's been too long since I really read fiction -- _Three-Body Problem_ recently, _The Martian_ before that, and I honestly couldn't tell you what the last piece of fiction before that was -- and this has been really engaging.

The home networking has _not_ been engaging, unless the occasional suckiness counts as engaging. Since where I live means I cannot jump up to the high speeds that so many people I know have, and I'm at the point where I'm needing to diagnose to see what is the pain point. I'm looking at the Wirecutter's suggestion for _Best Cable Modem_, but I'm also 50/50 on whether that's the problem.

It _could_ be that the only way to get internet with the speed and reliability I require is to move. `:shrug:`

In _Stay At Home_ news, yesterday I didn't. There were three things related to mail that needed to be taken care of, and while my wife briefed my youngest (still in need of drivers' training) on it, I took the opportunity to 1) instruct him more, 2) fill up on gas that is about \$.50 less than I had put in this vehicle previously, and 3) pick up some of the groceries that we can't have delivered. And mouthwash. I _did_ wear a mask -- the bandit bandana because I haven't acquired a more standard mask.

I'm reasonably healthy for a sedentary large mammal from the American Midwest, but I'm also pushing the age range where the current plague really starts to hit. I'm not fearful -- but I am, or at least I'm trying to be -- prudent. This means that I'm either gonna get myself a mask or I'm gonna stick at home, which of course, has it's own health outcome.

I wish you all health and happiness.

**Note to self:** I got sunglass lenses put into my still-good frames, but again, when things started shutting down was when the sunglasses should've been done, and they, along with everyone, are shut down for a while. When things get more normal, remind me to contact them.
