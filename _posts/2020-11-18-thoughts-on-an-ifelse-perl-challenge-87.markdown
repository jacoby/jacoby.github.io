First, we consider the challenge.

### TASK #1 â€º Longest Consecutive Sequence

> Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar  
> You are given an unsorted array of integers @N.
>
> Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence. Print 0 if none sequence found.

First, let us note words that are not in this challenge. _Positive_ and _unique_ stand out to me. _Non-zero_ is also absent. This will have to accept `-1, -1, 0, -1` as an acceptable input, even if the examples all use unique, positive, non-zero integers.

My take on this is to first sort the unsorted array, then create an array of arrays, each sub-array being a sequence.

![First Form of Sequence Array](https://jacoby.github.io/images/87-01.jpg)

Taking the array `-1, -1, 0, -1, 7, 13, 15` as an example, the multidimensional array would look like:

```json
[[-1, 0], [7], [13, 15]];
```

But that isn't the most helpful. We can then sort by sequence length to ensure that the longest ones are first.

![Text](https://jacoby.github.io/images/87-02.jpg)

```json
[[-1, 0], [13, 15], [7]];
```

We then take the first and go from there.

```json
[-1, 0]
```

#### Aside

Looking back, I'm struck that having two arrays, _current_ and _longest_, and copying _current_ onto _longest_ when _current_ is as long or longer than _longest_. It's a _good_ implementation, but it is not what I wrote.

#### What I wrote

I use subroutine signatures. Your syntax may vary.

```perl
    my $zed = [];
    my $n   = 0;
    for my $i ( uniq sort { $a <=> $b } @array ) {

        if ( !$zed->[$n][-1] || $i == $zed->[$n][-1] + 1 ) {
            # this is intentionally empty
        }
        else {
            $n++;
        }
        push $zed->[$n]->@*, $i;
    }
```

Two words: _sorted_ and _unique_. Sorting makes the process easier, because then you only have to compare the current integer with the previous integer, instead of the whole array. And uniqueness removes a hinderance, because with `1, 2, 2, 3`, the second `2` is not `2 + 1`, so you might end up with `1, 2` as your longest sequence if you're not careful. Thus `uniq sort { $a <=> $b }`.

(By default, Perl sorts alphabetically, which gives the order `69,7,70` instead of `7,69,70`. Perl things more in terms of text than numbers, which is fine but important to remember.)

Which gets to the reason I decided to blog this.

```perl
        if ( !$zed->[$n][-1] || $i == $zed->[$n][-1] + 1 ) {
            # this is intentionally empty
        }
        else {
            $n++;
        }
```

In long form: _if there's nothing in the current sequence, or if the current integer is the integer following the last integer in the current sequence, do nothing. Otherwise, increment the sequence index._

Or as I wrote on Twitter the other day,

```perl
        if ( conditions ) { }
        else { $n++ }
```

This works. It is clear. It contains a no-op block. I hate it, but I hate it not quite enough to rewrite it.

I mean, the logic is clear to me, and changing it to negate it all is likely going to be pretzel logic, or instead:

```perl
        if ( !( conditions ) ) { $n++ }
```

Which looks to me like a code version of this _My Cousin Vinny_ line:

!["Everything that guy just said is bullshit."](https://jacoby.github.io/images/bull.gif)

Sawyer X suggests 

```perl
        conditions or $n++ ;
```

That's nice. I like that. I'm going with it.
