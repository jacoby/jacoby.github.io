On we go into [Weekly Challenge #160](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-160/), which, for me, is being solved while I've absconded to an undisclosed location deep in the American Southwest.

[160](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/160_(number)) is the sum of the first 11 primes, as well as the sum of the cubes of the first three primes. There could be more fun to it, but I spent the day driving out to see Burros.
