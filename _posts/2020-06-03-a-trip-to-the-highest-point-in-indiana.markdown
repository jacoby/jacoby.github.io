There's a YouTuber whose channel is called [The Tim Traveller](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2LVhJH_9cT2XKp0VAfsKOQ). He has a few basic styles of video:

- Trains, primarily old trains in Europe. [But not exclusively.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8iCbjNGKlE)
- Interesting manmade things, like [the longest apartment building in the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzGnyqpvwG8), [the world's longest conveyor belt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FzgaSWDDw) and [an amazing abandoned hotel in the Azores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdYwP--TNoU).
- The highest points of places that are not impressive.

I _think_ the point is to get to the highest points in every country in Europe, but, while some are quite low and easy, such as [Luxembourg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8puG5Y1rlPM). In fact, to celebrate 50,000 subscribers, he had [a meetup to climb to the highest natural point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilQ3B7l0_jo) in [Flevoland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland), a province of the Netherlands that was largely reclaimed from the sea.

The state where I live, Indiana, is far from the sea (I'm about 800 miles/1300 km) but is far above it as well (about 700 feet or 215 meters). But, the highest point in Indiana, [Hoosier Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoosier_Hill), is basically a low hill in the middle of corn fields, so it'd be very easy to get to and climb. So I did.

And I've been teaching my son to drive, so this served double-duty.

### Getting There

Hoosier Hill is 13 miles north of Richmond and just west of the Ohio border. I don't think there's much of a way to get there using public transportation, which makes it distinct from the high places that Tim covers. But, once you get there, there's a gravel strip where you can park, and shallow climb up a dirt road to get to the actual marker.

Tim wished us ["Good Luck and Stay Safe"](https://twitter.com/TheTimTraveller/status/1266838789147811844), and I did. There were a pair of climbers descending as we arrived, and another group showed up just as we were leaving. We never got closer than ten feet/three meters to anyone outside of our household, so there was little chance of us participating in the spread of COVID-19.

I was tempted to add Campbell Hill, [the highest point in Ohio](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Hill_(Ohio)>), which is only another hour drive away, or so, but decided that this was long enough.
